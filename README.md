# Hi, I'm Dein (@ValkyrieNexus)

## About Me

I'm a career military professional (24+ years) transitioning into the tech sector, combining decades of computer experience with formal development training. Currently working through the Boot.dev curriculum to build solid programming fundamentals while exploring the intersection of development, infrastructure, and automation.

With a BS in Business Administration and MS in Project Management, I bring a unique perspective to technology projects - understanding both the technical implementation and business strategy behind solutions.

Currently serving in the military and preparing for my transition to civilian life in the next couple of years. I'm excited about the next chapter and building a career in technology.

## Current Focus

I'm exploring where development, infrastructure, and business strategy intersect. While AI is transforming how we build software, I'm focused on understanding the fundamentals and finding where human creativity and strategic thinking add the most value. My interests span cloud computing, fintech, and defense contracting - areas where my military experience provides valuable context.
